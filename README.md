# AI Interview Mockup

## Overview
AI Interview Mockup is a website that helps users prepare for job interviews. Users can input job details, and the AI will generate relevant interview questions. They can record their responses and receive feedback for improvement. Built with React, Django REST Framework (DRF), and Tailwind CSS, this project aims to provide a realistic interview experience to help users get ready with confidence.

## Features
